S - Do One Thing and Do It Well

O - Possibility to change behaviors without modifying code is good. E.g. with Higher Order Functions.

L - Just use common interfaces when makes sense (remember, there is no strict inheritance)

I - Split the global complex interfaces into more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them.
  "If I don't need the method, it shouldn't be there."

D - Angular :) Higher Order Functions
