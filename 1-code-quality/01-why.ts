Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

Martin Fowler


Why do I need it?

Boss just told us to do it, and we did it

YOU are PERSONALLY responsible for your code, not your boss

Functionality, quality, maintainability, bugs and errors etc.

But we are Frontenders...

Falcon 9

NPM

It's even more serious for the Frontend




OK, you start a new project...

It's NOT about reusability / flexibility in first place

It's NOT about experience

It's about readability and maintainability

The perfectly working code that I don't understand
 vs
The code that doesn't work at all that I DO understand

The usual attitude is: just make it work. It works already, right?

How much time the refactoring would take?

"It was like that already!"

The culture of writing the Clean Code. Development Ethics

Continuous process

It's even more important on Lead / Architect level, you see how every line of your code becomes a fractal





So, what is Code Quality? What means to write a Clean Code?

- Reads as well-written prose
- You feel that the author of this code cares about you
- Code is written with respect to the reader and the Craft overall
- You ENJOY reading and writing it
