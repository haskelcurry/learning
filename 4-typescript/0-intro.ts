The official documentation is brilliant.
However, for some reason people tend not to read it :)
We all know Java and C# and OOP, right?
Well, the thing is that Typescript is different, more into FP world

So, if you read the documentation thoroughly, you know the advanced usage of TS, and this meeting would be boring for you, sorry :D

Ok, let's have a quick tour over the documentation now!

// (show handbook)
// (show .JS)
// (show examples)
// Ok, our first stop in our journey gonna be our favorite type, the "any" type
// I know that there ARE projects that do use TS, but just passing "any" all around, effectively ruining the very idea of the typechecking...
