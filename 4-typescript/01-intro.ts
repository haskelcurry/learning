// The official documentation of the Typescript is brilliant.
// (open it)
// However, for some reason people tend not to read it :)
// We all know Java and C# and OOP, right?
//   little bit of inheritance, little bit of interfaces...
// Well, the thing is that Typescript is different
// Meet the TS Handbook!
https://www.typescriptlang.org/
// (show handbook)
// For FP programmers, show Haskell, etc.

// So... if you read the documentation thoroughly, you know the advanced 
// usage of TS, and this meeting would be boring for you, sorry :D

// Ok let's see our main tool for today, the playground
https://www.typescriptlang.org/play
// (show .JS)
// (show examples)
// Ok, our first stop in our journey gonna be our favorite type, the "any" type
// I know that there are projects that DO use TS, but just passing "any" 
// all around, effectively ruining the very idea of the typechecking...
